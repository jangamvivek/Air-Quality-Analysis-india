##Introduction
# Air Quality Analysis of Indian Cities
Analyzing air quality data across 26 Indian cities and 7 pollutants (e.g., AQI, PM2.5, PM10) to uncover regional and seasonal trends. This project uses Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization.

## Features
- Comprehensive air quality data analysis for 26 Indian cities.
- Comparison of pollution levels (e.g., AQI, PM2.5, PM10) across regions and seasons.
- Interactive Tableau dashboards for geographical visualization.
- 
## Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seshupavan/air-pollution-data-of-india-2020-2023) and supplemented with external sources where necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Tableau:** Visualization of data using geographical and temporal maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For exploratory data analysis (EDA).
